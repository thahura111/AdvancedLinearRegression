## General Information
- This case study show a housing company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
- Here we build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and shows features which are significant in predicting the price of a house

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis :
	Using Ridge regression the most important features are :
		 'OverallQual'
		 'GrLivArea'
		 '1stFlrSF'
		 'TotalBsmtSF'
		 'BsmtFinSF1'
		 'GarageArea'

- Conclusion 2 from the analysis :
	Using Lasso regression the most important features are :
		 'GrLivArea'
		 'OverallQual'
		 'YearBuilt'
		 'BsmtFinSF1'
		 'TotalBsmtSF'
		 'YearRemodAdd'


## Technologies Used
- python  - version 3
